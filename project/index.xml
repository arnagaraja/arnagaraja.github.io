      <description>Overview I don&amp;rsquo;t use Twitter. But, a lot of people do: globally, there are about 6000 tweets per second. So, I decided to make a visualization of tweets over time, using their geolocation tags to plot them on a map.
First things first - how do I scrape data from Twitter? It took a little digging, but I found the excellent streamR package, which interfaces with the Twitter API. Twitter&amp;rsquo;s API lets you sample the stream of public tweets in realtime.</description>

      <description>Overview Having studied and taught martial arts and self-defense for more than a decade, I have long been wondering about gun violence in the United States. It seems like I hear about someone getting killed or injured because of a gun every single day. Living in Chicago and having grown up in Baltimore, I am often exposed (daily; sometimes multiple times per day) to news reports about gang violence involving guns, and I am curious about how these cities compare to other places in the United States.</description>
