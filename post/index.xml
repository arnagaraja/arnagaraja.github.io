      <description>Overview Having a background and keen interest in martial arts and self-defense for many years, I have long been wondering about the state of gun violence in the United States. It seems like I hear about someone getting killed or injured because of a gun every single day, and it seems like it’s getting worse. Living in Chicago and having grown up in Baltimore, I am often exposed (daily; sometimes multiple times per day) to news reports about gang violence involving guns, and I am curious about how these cities compare to other places in the United States.</description>
